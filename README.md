# Water-Walkers Event Attendance Tracker

## Description
Partnered with Water Walkers for VandyHacks 2020, we designed a web application for easy, quick, and convenient check-in for attendance tracking. It allows for students to sign up, sign in, and register for events, while staff members can keep track of student profiles and event attendance.

Please find the deployed version at https://water-walkers.herokuapp.com/.
