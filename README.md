# Water-Walkers Event Attendance Tracker

## Description
Partnered with Water Walkers for VandyHacks 2020, we designed a web application for easy, quick, and convenient check-in for attendance tracking. It allows for students to sign up, sign in, and register for events, while staff members can keep track of student profiles and event attendance.
